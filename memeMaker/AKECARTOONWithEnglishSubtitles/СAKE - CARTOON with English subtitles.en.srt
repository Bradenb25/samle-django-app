They sing:

00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:46,060
-We dig our little bit of land,
and planting seeds

9
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:49,091

-Wheat will rise as high as a wall

11
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:56,120
-Do not be lazy! It will grow!
By fall we'll eat pie's!

12
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:16,011
All those day-old chicks make such a noise,
You can't get any sleep like that.

13
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:21,067
-I do not understand these chicks.
What are they doing?

14
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:37,118
-What? You're not strong enough!

15
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:41,076
-No way! It won't move!

16
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:45,109
-Okay, wait a minute! I will help!

18
00:01:53,086 --> 00:02:00,110
-This is not easy, the stump has too many roots.
We need to call the neighbours for help.

19
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,173
-Sharik! Murzik!

20
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,101
-Could you give us a hand?

21
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:49,015
My health is not good.I have a stomach ache!

22
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:52,065
-I have bronchitis.

23
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:55,088
-I have swollen heels!

24
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,037
I'm shaking with fever!

25
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:02,070
<i> coughs. </ i></i>

26
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:07,103
Toothache. Help!

27
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,065
-Oh! I cannot see with my right eye!

28
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:16,076
-All right, slackers, keep in bed!
We'll manage without you!

29
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:19,055
<i> laugh. </ i></i>

30
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:25,165
-One, two, heave!
How frustrating this stump is!

31
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:20,022
-Sharik! Murzik! Come to work!

32
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,116
-That's really worrying.

33
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:46,025
-I am not accustomed to work.
- I am not a servant of chickens!

34
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:49,136
Chorus:-We support you and so
we get our share of the pie!

35
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:53,090

<i> laugh </ i></i>

37
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:05,058
-We have a sharp sickle,
Many bundles of wheat we'll cut.

38
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:08,102
-Do not be lazy! It will soon get done!
By fall we'll eat pie's!

39
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,078
Beat forcefully! Strike together in harmony!

40
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:14,097
-Do not be lazy! It will soon get done!
By fall we'll eat pie's!

41
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:34,119
Let's call-in their help, in any case.
-No use, it's a wasted effort!

42
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:39,104
Little chickens do not write me my lessons!
-Let her go. Perhaps they will come!

43
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,162
-Good day! I came to call you for your help
to thresh the corn.

We are just busy cleaning
We cleaned out the closet!

45
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:14,036
Help us, dear doggy! Help us pleas kitten!

46
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,101
The chickens are to small to manage this.

47
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,046
Hatchie!

48
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:20,018

-Do not talk, and help me!

52
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:22,022
-The time has come!
We reached the bottom of our porridge jar!

53
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,195
-We're out of crackers too!

54
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,025
-Murzik!, And Sharik!

55
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:11,133
-It has risen enough,
And now it's time to bake it!

56
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,060
-Where are you going?
-And where are you going?

57
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:25,135
-Just somewhere!-And I'm there first!

58
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:34,085
-Get out of the way,  cat!
Stand back!
-Give me that spoon!

59
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:59,025
-Who in the spring has worked in the field
gets his share!

60
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,116
-Lazy slackers
We didn't invite you for pie!

61
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:31,175
-Here, take it. I just gave up.
No, thank you. Take it yourself.

62
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:49,015
Bring back your spoon, and your empty bowl.
We do not feed lazy bums!
