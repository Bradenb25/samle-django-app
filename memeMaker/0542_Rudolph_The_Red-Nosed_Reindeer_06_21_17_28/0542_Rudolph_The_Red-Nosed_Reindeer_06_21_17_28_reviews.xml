  <review>
    <reviewbody>Fun adaptation of the classic carol put to the screen by Jam Handy and the Fleischer Brothers. There may be a few alterations (I thought Santa owned Rudolph all along... in this, he just kidnaps him from his reindeer home) but all in all, the kids will like it,</reviewbody>
    <reviewtitle>Puts a new perspective on "Amber Alert".</reviewtitle>
