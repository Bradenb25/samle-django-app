1
00:00:10,18 --> 00:00:12,90
You know does your
emergency room run soon.

2
00:00:13,10 --> 00:00:19,94
Nixon coming to New Moon

3
00:00:19,94 --> 00:00:26,80
become old the most through don't

4
00:00:26,80 --> 00:00:28,35
think no stranger.

5
00:00:29,67 --> 00:00:36,54
I have a very shy nice you
live where you would even

6
00:00:36,54 --> 00:00:43,48
say on the range. You're so nice and calm.

7
00:00:45,85 --> 00:00:46,23
They know.

8
00:00:49,02 --> 00:00:54,59
Gine any reindeer get Christmas

9
00:00:59,72 --> 00:01:04,46
with your nose so briars you
guys nice night tonight.

10
00:01:05,58 --> 00:01:12,58
Then how the reindeer not been
shown the dogs with Rudolph

11
00:01:12,58 --> 00:01:15,91
the Red nosed Reindeer you'll go down

12
00:01:15,91 --> 00:01:21,18
and see it was the day before Christmas

13
00:01:21,98 --> 00:01:27,05
and old through the hills the remainder
will play enjoying the spoons of skating

14
00:01:27,05 --> 00:01:31,02
and coasting and flaming
the willows and hopscotch

15
00:01:31,02 --> 00:01:46,06
and Leap Frog protected by Philip Bellows

16
00:01:46,07 --> 00:01:53,02
who well you know

17
00:01:53,02 --> 00:01:59,81
I read it a few times I write nothing.

18
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,34
I'm the guy off.

19
00:02:02,61 --> 00:02:06,35
For Rudolph where most
reindeers noses are brownish

20
00:02:06,35 --> 00:02:10,16
and tiny Rudolph was red very large

21
00:02:10,16 --> 00:02:21,42
and quite telling me I

22
00:02:21,42 --> 00:02:23,64
don't really know you know.

23
00:02:32,05 --> 00:02:32,38
Come come.

24
00:02:32,58 --> 00:02:59,81
LOU DOBBS TONIGHT you hang
up your stocking make

25
00:02:59,82 --> 00:03:05,14
him live eat white rice

26
00:03:12,56 --> 00:03:17,78
while away a way up north on this dark
funky night awaiting the time for his

27
00:03:17,78 --> 00:03:19,22
Christmas Eve place.

28
00:03:19,27 --> 00:03:26,11
Good old man this fog will
be hard to get through

29
00:03:29,55 --> 00:03:31,01
the room is

30
00:03:40,43 --> 00:03:47,06
required if I'm right
there is a dancer Prancer

31
00:03:47,06 --> 00:03:52,03
next to Thomas to bed down a less a

32
00:03:58,04 --> 00:03:58,32
better world.

33
00:04:10,60 --> 00:04:11,60
To keep the direction.

34
00:04:11,76 --> 00:04:20,80
Will I prefer a low income Americans.

35
00:04:27,36 --> 00:04:28,41
Don't do it quick.

36
00:04:32,56 --> 00:04:38,11
Oh you're married

37
00:04:40,70 --> 00:04:40,72
now.

38
00:04:50,78 --> 00:04:59,52
Good for your groceries.

39
00:05:03,37 --> 00:05:03,56
I know

40
00:05:12,29 --> 00:05:15,05
the air was still foggy and dark

41
00:05:15,05 --> 00:05:18,12
and we're in the center of a
riot at the home of the deer.

42
00:05:20,36 --> 00:05:24,26
But all this took time to
kill Santa with blue Miles.

43
00:05:24,34 --> 00:05:30,14
Only he pulled toward the next
leap years from the dam plus

44
00:05:30,14 --> 00:05:36,18
and burning the gloom came instead from
Rudolph's red nose at the head of the bed

45
00:05:37,98 --> 00:05:41,30
and then came the greatest
idea in all this debate.

46
00:05:43,37 --> 00:05:47,89
So Rudolph is told of the
dark and delay come into play

47
00:05:47,89 --> 00:05:54,58
and losing the way I need you tonight
to leave all my dear on the rest of our

48
00:05:54,58 --> 00:05:59,84
life to you and.

49
00:06:01,21 --> 00:06:02,41
You want to help.

50
00:06:03,46 --> 00:06:09,75
Don't worry come back for me
early on it's very dark you know

51
00:06:16,49 --> 00:06:22,42
with those of the wonderful life old fans
of flu quickly the rest of the night

52
00:06:27,40 --> 00:06:27,47
be a

53
00:06:42,77 --> 00:06:46,18
good day a

54
00:06:53,96 --> 00:06:54,88
plane went so fast

55
00:06:54,88 --> 00:07:06,70
that before it was Dave the very
loved person was given the way he

56
00:07:06,71 --> 00:07:13,43
gave you a room just a phone
Rudolph's mistake it's all

57
00:07:13,43 --> 00:07:14,44
over tone

58
00:07:29,35 --> 00:07:32,06
deaf ears who used to do
nothing but tease him.

59
00:07:32,36 --> 00:07:46,81
Well no they do anything only to please.

60
00:07:47,55 --> 00:07:51,19
Root out my boy and you know I'll run

61
00:07:52,25 --> 00:07:54,60
but no greater I'll come come to a day

62
00:07:55,32 --> 00:07:59,81
when riding with some guy
be my sway the number one.

63
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,87
Job number was I hope you'll get there
due to the post from grief I hereby

64
00:08:06,87 --> 00:08:10,42
applying to compound the truth

65
00:08:17,46 --> 00:08:23,45
and Rudolf just life from his head to his
toes until his pay for was as red as his

66
00:08:23,45 --> 00:08:30,17
No Merry Christmas to zero in to

67
00:08:31,14 --> 00:08:35,86
C.N.N. Now the rain came

68
00:08:37,18 --> 00:08:44,03
and the shouting Andres grade
the red nosed main thing you go

69
00:08:44,03 --> 00:08:45,07
down in here is.
