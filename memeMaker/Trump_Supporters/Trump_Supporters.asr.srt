1
00:00:00,15 --> 00:00:04,67
And as happens these days when Trump makes
an appearance so do the protesters are

2
00:00:04,68 --> 00:00:10,79
by when Scott has that story. This is where
all the action is taking place at the

3
00:00:10,80 --> 00:00:14,90
Gaylord National Harbor that the president
speaks to his supporters but across the

4
00:00:14,91 --> 00:00:17,66
street here of those who
don't support him they are

5
00:00:17,67 --> 00:00:23,08
a group of protesters all
over the shuttle was

6
00:00:23,39 --> 00:00:28,06
a relatively small but vocal group of
protesters gathered in the shadow of the

7
00:00:28,07 --> 00:00:33,10
Gaylord National Harbor this morning
that it was a Their mission to send

8
00:00:33,11 --> 00:00:37,94
a message to President Donald Trump and his
supporters Unfortunately his stance and

9
00:00:37,95 --> 00:00:42,55
hers policy just don't match what the
people here need and what we want as

10
00:00:42,56 --> 00:00:45,36
president you know we're supposed to have
the government serving the people and

11
00:00:45,37 --> 00:00:49,99
right now that's not the case they targeted
all the usual suspects tribes pledged

12
00:00:50,00 --> 00:00:52,92
to get rid of Obamacare and in
Prince George's County that's

13
00:00:52,93 --> 00:00:54,79
a big deal not just because it's half

14
00:00:54,80 --> 00:00:57,61
a million people that are going to health
care but when you combine that with the

15
00:00:57,62 --> 00:01:01,77
fact that one of President Trump supporters
governor Hogan is trying to play games

16
00:01:01,78 --> 00:01:05,58
with funding our new Prince George's
Hospital Center literally like access to

17
00:01:05,59 --> 00:01:09,40
health care in our county is it is
literally on the line on the president's

18
00:01:09,41 --> 00:01:14,14
immigration policy I don't think if you
represent the values certainly not of

19
00:01:14,15 --> 00:01:17,84
Democrats and I don't think of conservatives
either and so I think this is

20
00:01:17,85 --> 00:01:22,82
a really important moment and trumps promise
to make America great again trust and

21
00:01:22,83 --> 00:01:26,84
believe the bill that may come back the
black cloak angle be to want to get new

22
00:01:26,85 --> 00:01:31,52
jobs in these businesses he's bringing back
the coalition of groups spearheaded by

23
00:01:31,53 --> 00:01:35,60
the Prince George's County Young Democrats
assembled directly across the street

24
00:01:35,61 --> 00:01:40,28
from the sea packed gathering Trump
supporters passing by stopped to mingle with

25
00:01:40,29 --> 00:01:43,41
protesters sparking moments
of debate and have

26
00:01:43,42 --> 00:01:46,73
a vetting process now that the jury betting
is what you're doing that you can't

27
00:01:46,74 --> 00:01:51,84
predict the extreme betting is what we have
now not surprisingly no points of view

28
00:01:51,88 --> 00:01:55,40
appear to be altered but never played
here because you're coming from

29
00:01:55,41 --> 00:02:00,94
a complete emotional standpoint I'm
coming from a logical standpoint. That's

30
00:02:01,02 --> 00:02:05,56
a good likely are you right the building I
look at I do things I dare say we don't

31
00:02:05,57 --> 00:02:10,51
have to fight and while some may think.
Viz guys are crazy they are not nor are

32
00:02:10,52 --> 00:02:15,38
their opinions without conviction when
he was given regulations and bring Take

33
00:02:15,97 --> 00:02:20,24
destroy the iris He just announced the
Emancipation Proclamation because anything

34
00:02:20,25 --> 00:02:24,83
over ten percent taxes is legal slavery
I don't need no programs I just want my

35
00:02:24,84 --> 00:02:29,04
money and asking you politely to stop
saying that I didn't ask and while the give

36
00:02:29,05 --> 00:02:34,16
and take and times to appear tense it all
fell under the banner of democracy and

37
00:02:34,17 --> 00:02:39,27
police say that's just fine this is exactly
what we wanted to see people able to

38
00:02:39,65 --> 00:02:44,78
express their. Exercise
their freedom of speech. In

39
00:02:44,79 --> 00:02:48,48
a place where right in front of the Gaylord
we didn't stick them blocks and blocks

40
00:02:48,49 --> 00:02:51,61
away we wanted to make sure that they
felt like they were close enough to where

41
00:02:51,62 --> 00:02:58,33
their voices could be heard I by eleven
twenty five Marine One was in the air

42
00:02:58,57 --> 00:03:01,22
and the president was heading
back to Washington D.C.

43
00:03:01,63 --> 00:03:03,25
The protests here lasted all of

44
00:03:03,26 --> 00:03:07,52
a couple of hours the hope of course is
that the message resonates far longer but

45
00:03:07,53 --> 00:03:12,08
that of course remains to be seen at
National Harbor Byron Scott C.T.V. News.
